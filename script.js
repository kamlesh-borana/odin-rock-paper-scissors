// Function to get random number
    // Get a random number between 0 and 1
    // Divide 1 by the number of random numbers needed, the result value divides the number 1 into the required random numbers equal parts 
    // Check if the random number is lower than the first part, if true return one of the desired random number
    // Check if the random number is lower than the second part, if true return some other random number
    // Repeat it until only the last part is needed to be checked in which case return the last remaining desired random number
